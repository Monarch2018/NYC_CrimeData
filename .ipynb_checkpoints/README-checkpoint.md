### Description
The dataset includes all valid felony, misdemeanor, and violation crimes reported to the New York City Police Department in the first quarter of 2018. Some crimes are successfully completed while others are “attempted” but failed or were interrupted prematurely. We seek to understand the pattern behind successfully completed criminal activities by building classification models to predict whether a crime is “successful” or “unsuccessful.” It’s important to understand what factors lead to a successful crime in determining how to better distribute public resources.
