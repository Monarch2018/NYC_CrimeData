# Predicting “Successful” Criminal Activity in New York City

### Problem Definition and Motivation
The dataset includes all valid felony, misdemeanor, and violation crimes reported to the New York City Police Department from 2006 to 2015. Some crimes are successfully completed while others are “attempted” but failed or were interrupted prematurely. We seek to understand the pattern behind successfully completed criminal activities by building a classification model to predict whether a crime is “successful” or “unsuccessful.” It’s important to understand what factors lead to a successful crime in determining how to better distribute public resources throughout the city.

### Methodology
Python will be used to introduce multiple linear models to our dataset. The goal is to find the best fitting model and evaluate the accuracy of the classification. We plan to clean the data and then utilize SK Learn for the various models. Initially we plan to test logistic regression, Adaline, and Perceptron models to see which works the best. We may implement additional models depending on what we learn later in the class.
